Problem Description

A soccer game operates under slightly different soccer rules. A goal is
only counted if the 4 players, in order, who touched the ball prior to the goal have jersey
numbers that are in strictly increasing numeric order with the highest number being the
goal scorer.
Players have jerseys numbered from 1 to 99 (and each jersey number is worn by exactly
one player).
Given a jersey number of the goal scorer, indicate how many possible combinations of
players can produce a valid goal.

Input Specification
The input will be the positive integer J (1 <= J <= 99), which is the jersey number of the
goal scorer.

Output Specification

The output will be one line containing the number of possible scoring combinations that
could have J as the goal scoring jersey number.
